# Pennsylvania Dutch Recipe Swap

My third Milestone project is called the Pennsylvania Dutch Recipe Swap, a site where viewers can look a collection of Pennsylvania Dutch cooking recipes, and if they want leave some recipes of their own.  This site features Python's web framework, Flask.

## UX

## Features

The viewers have come to the Pennsylvania Dutch Recipe Swap, a website where they may read and exchange recipes from Pennsylvania's Pennsylvania Dutch culture.  First, the viewers will see that the site is sponsered by a local cooking supply company.  Then they will see the collection of recipes, where each recipe is made up of four different entries:  The course, which is either an entree, side dish, salad or desert; the name of the dish; the ingredients; and, finally, how to prepare the dish.  On the face of each recipe, viewers will see the name of the dish, and two buttons, the Update button, which will let them change the recipe, and the Delete button, which will eliminate the recipe.  The Update button will take the viewers to another page, the Update page, where the recipe is displayed.  They may change the recipe and then save it.  The recipe will reappear on the Home page.  Lets go back to the Home page, where, underneath the collection of recipes, viewers will see a Search bar, with which they can find any recipe, food item or name of meal course.  The last page is the Add Recipe page, which can be found by hitting the Add Recipe button on the Nav Bar.  There viewers will see a big field with four different entries, which looks the same as the Update recipe page, where they can leave a recipe and save it.
